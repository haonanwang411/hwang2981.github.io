I am a second-year Master student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), and a research assistant at the ISLE lab working with [Prof.Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/) 

Prior to JHU, I received my B.S. degree in Information and Computer Science, and Mathematics from the [Liaoning Technology University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/).

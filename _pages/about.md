I am a second-year Master student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), and a research assistant at the ISLE lab working with [Prof.Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/) 

Prior to JHU, I received my B.S. degree in Information and Computer Science, and Mathematics from the [Liaoning Technology University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/). During my undergrad study, I spent time at the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science and the Institute of Machel Learning and Data Mining, where I was advised by [Prof. Wei liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei-Liu-523) and [Prof.Yu Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Zhang-264) working in Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Informatics Theory, Numerical Analysis, and Math Modeling and Optimization Algorithms field.


**Research interest:** My research objective is in the area of the intersection of **human-computer interaction(HCI)**
and **Natural Language Processing(NLP)** evaluation and application. Specifically, exploring
how we can understand, leverage, and evaluate generative AI technologies, like **Large Language
Models(LLMs)** from a human-centered interactive perspective. And build interactive NLP systems
based on these explorations to enhance human decision-making in a collaborative manner.
